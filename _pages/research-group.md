I am affiliated to the Advanced Networks Research Group at University of Liverpool. Our group has six academic staff and has strong expertise in the area of wireless communication, wireless security, trust, information theory, artificial intelligence applications in communications, signal processing for communications, 5G, embedded system designs. We very welcome research collaborations and visits.

I am always looking for excellent PhD students, post-doc, and visiting researchers. All our research is carried out by exploiting the wireless channels for  innovative applications. The three topics that I am particularly interested are
* [Key generation from wireless channels](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/research-area/keygen/){:target="_blank"}
* [Radio frequency fingerprinting identification](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/research-area/rffi/){:target="_blank"}
* Device free wireless sensing

If you are interested, please drop me an email (junqing.zhang at liverpool.ac.uk) with you CV. 

# Opening

# Potential Funding
## Newton International Fellowships for Post-Doc
The [Newton International Fellowships](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/){:target="_blank"} application will open in 2020. Please contact us if you are interested.

## China Scholarship Council for PhD Students and Visiting Researchers
We are proud to be the partner of CSC scholarship. This is a very generous scholarship which provides full financial support. In particular, our university will waive the tuition fee and CSC will provide the living allowance.

The application will open every year around October. Please note this is a two step application. You should submit a full application to our university first. You have to get a unconditional offer before you place a CSC application to our university. The deadline for this step is usually in the middle of January. Once you are successful at step 1, you will then submit a full application to the CSC in China. The deadline is usually in the middle of March.

For more information please check [our university website](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/fees-and-funding/scholarships-and-awards/the-university-of-liverpool-and-china-scholarship-council-awards/){:target="_blank"} and also the CSC website.

CSC also has funding for visiting researchers, including visiting PhDs and scholars.

## UK Jiangsu 20+20 programme for Visiting Researchers
If you are PhD students or scholars in universities of Jiangsu Province, China, another potential route is the [UK Jiangsu 20+20 programme](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/posts/2019/04/blog-post-uk-jiangsu-collaboration/){:target="_blank"}. Under this scheme, PhD and ECRs will be supported for six months and one year, respectively.
