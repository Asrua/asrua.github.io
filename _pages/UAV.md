# Overview
Path planning for a large number of autonomous vehicles is challenging due to complex interactions between them. A trajectory optimization algorithm, which jointly consider the energy consumption and obstacle avoidance, is proposed in this work. 

# Experiment
* Robotics swarm experiment is conducted with [Robotarium](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech
* Numerical simulations: Matlab
