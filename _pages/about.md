I am a Ph.D. student from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in University of Houston since 2018. My advisor is [Dr.Zhu Han](http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~zhan2/){:target="_blank"}, who founded the [wireless networking, signal processing and security lab](http://wireless.egr.uh.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2009. My research interests include mean field game, deep reinforcement learning, federated learning, and generative adversarial networks.  

I received my bachelor degree of Electrical & Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China) in 2014.
