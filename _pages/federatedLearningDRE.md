# Overview
Federated Learning (FL) enables devices to cooperatively train a machine learning (ML) model without sharing their private data. It has two key obstacles, however: a communication bottleneck and data heterogeneity. To overcome the communication challenge, I present a probabilistic device selection strategy that allows fewer devices to participate in training. To address the issue of data heterogeneity, we created a hierarchical FL to customize edge models for the devices.
