I have developed a strong research potential in innovative physical layer security solutions for future wireless technologies with ultra-low energy requirements but high security standards. My research aims to bridge the gap between the theoretical modelling and practical exploitation of physical layer security using state-of-the-art testbeds and equipment.

# Research Topics
In particular, my research aims to ensure the secure communication using key generation and device authentication using radio frequency fingerprint identification.

## Key Generation from Wireless Channels
* Key generation is an emerging technique to establish cryptographic keys between legitimate users by extracting randomness from their common channels.

## Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) Identification
* All the components of wireless devices will have slightly different features, e.g., carrier frequency of the oscillators, from the manufacturing processing. Similar to biometric fingerprint, these characteristics are unique and permanent, which can act as the fingerprint of the devices. This technique first requires collecting the device fingerprint and storing them in a database, and then classifies devices by comparing with the stored database whenever a device wishes to join the network.
