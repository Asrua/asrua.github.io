Our research can be assisted by many useful and easy-to-use tools, for producing fancy figures, creating demonstration video, writing Latex efficiently. There are also many tools to make our everyday work much easier. 
This page summarizes some useful tools that I am using. Most importantly, most of them are free.

# Figure
We strongly recommend to use vector figures for academic publication because of the good resolution. [Here](https://etc.usf.edu/techease/win/images/what-is-the-difference-between-bitmap-and-vector-images/){:target="_blank"} is a brief but good explanation about the difference between the bitmap and vector figures.

The only exceptions to use bitmap in academic publication are the photos of experimental setup and authors' biographies. 

Below are some tools to prepare good-looking vector figures.

## Matlab Export Figure
* Save Matlab figures to vector figures (pdf, eps), without margin
* Link: [https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig){:target="_blank"}  

## Matlab On-figure magnifier
* Plot zoomed 2D graphics of images on the same figure
* Link: [https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26007-on-figure-magnifier](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26007-on-figure-magnifier){:target="_blank"}  

## Drawing Diagrams - Draw.io
* A free online diagram and flowchart maker
* Link: [https://www.draw.io/](https://www.draw.io/){:target="_blank"}  

## Visio
If you have the license for Visio, this is a great tool to create flowcharts and diagrams.

# Video  

## Activepresenter
* A very good tool to create demonstration video. The layout is very similar to Powerpoint so it is very easy to use. Free version available.
* Link: [https://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/](https://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/){:target="_blank"}  
 

# LaTex

## LaTex Software 
 * If you are using LaTex with Windows, I strongly suggest to use the combination of Miktex+TeXnicCenter+Sumatra PDF viewer. They are very handy to use.
 * Download Link: [http://www.texniccenter.org/download/](http://www.texniccenter.org/download/){:target="_blank"}  
 * Please click [here](https://granasat.ugr.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How_to_Sumatra_EN.pdf){:target="_blank"} for a tutorial about the installation and setup.
   
## LaTex Online Tool - Overleaf
* Online Latex editor, suitable for collaboration
* Link: [https://www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com){:target="_blank"}   

## IEEE Latex Template
* IEEE template class, read the [document](http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf){:target="_blank"} 
* IEEE reference, Bibtex, download from [here](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex?lang=en){:target="_blank"} 

## Using Latex for Preparing Presentation
* Latex is also very good to prepare presentations. Please refer to [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer) for a tutorial.

## Generate Table for LaTex
* Excel2LATEX â€“ Convert Excel spreadsheets to LATEX tables. [https://ctan.org/pkg/excel2latex?lang=en](https://ctan.org/pkg/excel2latex?lang=en){:target="_blank"} 
* There are also many online table generators for LaTex. 

# Misc
## Notepad++
This is a quite handy and powerful text editor. It is free and you can download it from [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"}.

It has abundant plugins to expand the features. Some useful plugins are explained in this [link](https://medium.com/issuehunt/20-best-notepad-plugins-for-developers-183886939eab){:target="_blank"}.

## Github Pages
If you wish to build a personal page that looks professional, I strongly suggest you to use Github Pages. For more information, please refer to another [post](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/posts/2019/05/blog-post-building-a-website/){:target="_blank"}.

## Github Desktop

## Everything
A very small but handy tool to search all the files and folders in your PC. Free download from [here](https://www.voidtools.com/){:target="_blank"}. You don't have to remember where you store your files any more. Simply search by some words of the file names.
