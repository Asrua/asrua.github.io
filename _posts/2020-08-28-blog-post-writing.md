# How to Write a Paper
## Information for Authors
Each journal and conference will have information for authors, which will explain the requirements in terms of the number of pages, format, resubmission, page overlength charge, etc.

For example, the information for authors of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications can be found [here](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-twc/submit-manuscript){:target="_blank"}.

## Template
Each journal and conference will usually have both Word and Latex templates. When possible, the Latex templates are always recommended. Please read [this post](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/posts/2020/01/blog-post-latex/) for How to Use LaTex.

Please note that IEEE journals will have different templates. Download your right template from [here](https://template-selector.ieee.org/secure/templateSelector/publicationType){:target="_blank"}.


## Extending Conference Paper to Journal
There may be different rules for journals regarding extending a conference paper. Please refer to the website of the particular journal for detailed instruction.

For example, the policy of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications can be found [here](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-transactions-wireless-communications/conference-vs-journal){:target="_blank"}.
