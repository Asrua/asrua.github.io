# Overview
Journals can be mainly categorized into survey/tutorial-based and technical contribution-based. The latter can be further divided into regular papers (usually longer than eight pages) and letters (less than five pages).

A full list of the magazines and journals of the IEEE Communications Society can be found [here](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/submit-paper){:target="_blank"}.

# Survey/Tutorial
Survey and tutorial summarize the recent progress of a particular research area. Read these articles will help grab an overall understanding of the topic, which is very helpful, in particular to beginners.

An differentiation between tutorial and survey can be found at the [information for authors of IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-comst/ieee-communications-surveys-tutorials-submit-manuscript){:target="_blank"}. Generally speaking, survey articles aim to provide a comprehensive coverage while tutorial is usually written in a technical-light manner, to be understood even by non-expert.

# Note
## How to Prepare the Manuscript
Each journal and conference will have information for authors, which will explain the requirements in terms of the number of pages, format, etc.

For example, the information for authors of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications can be found [here](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-twc/submit-manuscript){:target="_blank"}.

## Extending Conference Paper to Journal
There may be different rules for journals regarding extending a conference paper. Please refer to the website of the particular journal for detailed instruction.

For example, the policy of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications can be found [here](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-transactions-wireless-communications/conference-vs-journal){:target="_blank"}.
