Latex is a good tool to prepare report, academic papers, presentations.
Different from Word, LaTex may look complicated and difficult to learn in the beginning. It is true, because Latex requires knowledge about the syntax and rules. The learning curve may a little steep but once you become a  master, you will love it. You will be able to produce a good looking report without worrying the format any more.

# Software
## Offline Software 
There are many Latex editors available and many of them are free to use. If you are using LaTex with Windows, I strongly suggest to use the combination of Miktex+TeXnicCenter+Sumatra PDF viewer. They are very handy to use.
 * Download Link: [http://www.texniccenter.org/download/](http://www.texniccenter.org/download/){:target="_blank"}  
 * Please click [here](https://granasat.ugr.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How_to_Sumatra_EN.pdf){:target="_blank"} for a tutorial about the installation and setup.
   
## LaTex Online Tool - Overleaf
* Online Latex editor, suitable for collaboration
* Link: [https://www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com){:target="_blank"} 

# Template
## IEEE Latex Template
* IEEE template class, read the [document](http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf){:target="_blank"} 
* IEEE reference, Bibtex, download from [here](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex?lang=en){:target="_blank"} 

## Presentation Beamer
* Latex is also very good to prepare presentations. Please refer to [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer) for a tutorial.

## Generate Table for LaTex
It is very difficult and unfriendly to generate a table from scratch in Latex. There are many tools available to make this tedious work much easier.

* Excel2LATEX â€“ Convert Excel spreadsheets to LATEX tables. [https://ctan.org/pkg/excel2latex?lang=en](https://ctan.org/pkg/excel2latex?lang=en){:target="_blank"} 
* There are also many online table generators for LaTex. 

Excel2LATEX is recommended over online table generators. It allows you to save the table in an Excel file and you can edit the table and regenerate the Latex source code whenever you want.

## Figure
* **Choose vector figure over bitmap**: It is strongly recommended to use vector figures for academic publication because of their good resolution. [Here](https://etc.usf.edu/techease/win/images/what-is-the-difference-between-bitmap-and-vector-images/){:target="_blank"} is a brief but good explanation about the difference between the bitmap and vector figures. Generate pdf or eps because they are vector figures.

* Code Snippet
One figure
```
\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{fig1.pdf}
	\caption{Caption.}
	\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}
```

In order to include subfigures, IEEE template recommends to use subfig.sty. Declare subfig package in the preamble:
```
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
\usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
```
Use the following code to include two subfigures
```
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{Pictures/fig1.pdf}
\label{fig:fig1}}\\
\subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{Pictures/fig2.pdf}
\label{fig:fig2}}
\caption{(a) Caption1. (b) Caption2.}
\label{fig:fig}
\end{figure}

```

# Bibliographies 
Bibtex is strongly recommended to organize reference in Latex. While it is very easy and efficient to use, there are a number of pitfalls. Please refer to this [tutorial](https://serialmentor.com/blog/2015/10/2/Bibtex){:target="_blank"} for details.

## Bibtex entries
In order to avoid any errors, it is strong advised to download the bibtex entries from the online database, rather than creating from scratch by yourself. For example, search the title in the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) and click "Import into BibTeX" to view the bibtex record. If it is not there, turn it on in the Settings of Google Scholar.

The bibtex entries downloaded from any database are unfortunately not fully correct. You will need to adjust it according to the target journal and also the pitfalls mentioned above. In particular, check the journal field and delete any fields that are not required.

## Multiple Bibliographies
If you need to create multiple bibliographies in the same document, [multibib](https://ctan.org/pkg/multibib?lang=en) can help you with this. Check [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/multibib) for an introduction and an example.
