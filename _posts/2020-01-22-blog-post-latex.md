Latex is a good tool to prepare report, academic papers, presentations.
Different from Word, LaTex may look complicated and difficult to learn in the beginning. It is true, because Latex requires knowledge about the syntax and rules. The learning curve may a little steep but once you become a  master, you will love it. You will be able to produce a good looking report without worrying the format any more.
