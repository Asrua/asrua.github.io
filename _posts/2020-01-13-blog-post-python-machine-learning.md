This paper summarizes resources for learning machine learning and deep learning with Python.

{% include toc %}

# Overview

# Installing Python
I strongly recommend installing [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/){:target="_blank"}.

# Machine Learning

## Tutorial
* [Python Machine Learning Tutorial, Scikit-Learn](https://elitedatascience.com/python-machine-learning-tutorial-scikit-learn){:target="_blank"}
* [Training Support Vector Machines for Multiclass Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/pranathichunduru/svm-for-multiclass-classification/){:target="_blank"}

# Deep Learning
## Tutorial
* [Your First Deep Learning Project in Python with Keras Step-By-Step](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/){:target="_blank"}
* [How to Develop 1D Convolutional Neural Network Models for Human Activity Recognition](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cnn-models-for-human-activity-recognition-time-series-classification/){:target="_blank"}
* [Getting started with the Keras Sequential model](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/){:target="_blank"}

## Code Snippet
* Check the installed packages
```
conda list
```

* Install a particular tensorflow version using conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow=1.13
```
