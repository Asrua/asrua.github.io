## Key Generation Survey
1. **Junqing Zhang**, Trung Q. Duong, Alan Marshall, and Roger Woods, “Key generation from wireless channels: A review,” _IEEE Access_, vol. 4, pp. 614- 626, Mar. 2016. Open Access. [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7393435)
  * This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the key generation, covering the key generation fundamental, principle, procedures, evaluation metrics, applications.

## Key Generation Principle
1. **Junqing Zhang**, Biao He, Trung Q. Duong, and Roger Woods, “On the key generation from correlated wireless channels,” _IEEE Communications Letters_,  vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 961 — 964, Apr. 2017. [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7809064)
1. **Junqing Zhang**, Alan Marshall, Roger Woods, and Trung Q. Duong, “Efficient key generation by exploiting randomness from channel responses of individual OFDM subcarriers,” _IEEE Transactions on Communications_, vol. 64, no. 6, pp. 2578 – 2588, Jun. 2016. Open Access. [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7448884)
  * This paper carries out comprehensive experimental studies on the key generation principles, including temporal variation, channel reciprocity, and spatial decorrelation. The experiments were carried out in the anechoic chamber, reverberation chamber, and indoor office environments.

Duong, Alan Marshall, and Yuan Ding, “Experimental study on channel reciprocity in wireless key generation,” in _Proc. 17th IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications Special Session on Physical Layer Security for 5G_, Edinburgh, UK, Jul. 2016 (Invited Paper). [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7536825)
  * This paper investigates channel reciprocity by an innovative experiment design. Two WARP boards were connected by a power splitter, which enabled analyzing effects of noise and non-simultaneous sampling.

Duong, “Efficient key generation by exploiting randomness from channel responses of individual OFDM subcarriers,” _IEEE Transactions on Communications_, vol. 64, no. 6, pp. 2578 – 2588, Jun. 2016. Open Access. [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7448884)
  * This paper studies the key generation application in OFDM systems. The temporal and frequency correlation is modelled. The channel reciprocity of subcarrier response is also modelled.

## Key Generation Application
1. **Junqing Zhang**, Alan Marshall, and Lajos Hanzo, “Channel-envelope differencing eliminates secret key correlation: LoRa-based key generation in low power wide area networks,” _IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology_, vol. 67, no. 12, pp. 12462-12466, Dec., 2018. [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8519327/)
  * This paper investigates key generation applied in long range communications, by taking LoRa as a case study.
1. Guyue Li, Aiqun Hu, Chen Sun and **Junqing Zhang**, “Constructing reciprocal channel coefficients for secret key generation in FDD systems,”  _IEEE Communications Letters_,  vol. 22, no. 12, pp. 2487 – 2490, Dec., 2018. [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8490674)
  * Key generation relies on channel reciprocity, which does not hold in FDD systems. This paper constructs correlated parameters which can be used for key generation.
